<p>Have you got a great idea that utilises open government data? This is your chance to turn that idea into a business!</p>
<p>We are excited to announce the launch of <strong>DataStart</strong> – an open data initiative being run by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet.</p>
<p>DataStart is a nation-wide campaign to find, incubate and accelerate startup ideas that leverage openly available data from the Australian Government. This is the start of a more comprehensive engagement with the private sector about the kinds of government datasets that can be used generate new business, develop new products and services, and create social value.</p>
<p>The Department is partnering with Pollenizer, an established Australian incubator, to deliver the initiative. Pollenizer has worked with thousands of entrepreneurs across Asia Pacific including some of the world’s largest companies such as Singtel and Coca Cola.</p>
<p>A number of large Australian organisations are also on board to support the initiative, including Optus, Google, PwC Australia, CSIRO’s Data61, Rozetta and the Australian Information Industry Association.</p>
<p>So how can you turn your innovative idea into a successful business?</p>
<p>Apply for <a href="http://www.datastart.com.au/">DataStart</a> – We want to know about you, your experience and, of course, your idea.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The top 20 shortlisted ideas will participate in a workshop facilitated by Pollenizer to refine their ideas in readiness for the showcase event on 18 January 2016. Teams will pitch their ideas to a panel of professionals and investors for the opportunity to embark on a nine month incubation program and gain access to an investment package valued up to $200,000.</p>
<p>You don’t need a team, company or product (although having these won’t necessarily exclude you) and you don’t need specific data analytical skills. What you do need is passion to join the digital disruption movement and an idea that makes use of one or more of the 7,500 open government datasets available.</p>
<p>The winning startup will receive the support, resources and mentorship of Pollenizer, with the aim being to develop the idea into a self-supporting business over the incubation period. The startup will also receive ongoing support from a team in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, who will assist the business with technical issues, customer discovery and data access.</p>
<p>Those teams that don’t go through to incubation will have had the chance to develop their concept with the mentorship of industry experts in the 5 day workshop. Teams will have the opportunity to make valuable connections within government, industry and investors at the showcase event.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>A series of DataStart information nights are being held across the country during November. Visit the <a href="http://www.datastart.com.au/">DataStart</a> website for dates, venues and details.</p>
