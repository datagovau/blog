<p>Data is the cornerstone to delivering better outcomes for all Australians. The growth in the data generation is enabling new and exciting business models, services and insights. In the health sector for example, administrative health data enables governments and researchers to identify risk factors and preventative characteristics to social, health or education problems, and measure the cost effectiveness of interventions and services for the entire population.</p>
<p>The Assistant Minister for Cities and Digital Transformation Angus Taylor MP recently met with renowned epidemiologist Professor Fiona Stanley AC to discuss some of these benefits.</p>
<p>In this first of a series of tech-talks, Professor Stanley spoke about her work including the <a href="https://www.telethonkids.org.au/our-research/brain-and-behaviour/development-and-education/linked-analytics-and-social-policy/developmental-pathways-project/">Developmental Pathways Project</a> that uses routinely collected data for improving health outcomes for Australian children.</p>
