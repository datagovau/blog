title: An August change to G-NAF will make tracking addresses easier
author: Stephen Cannings

<p>Geospatial data provider PSMA will implement changes to the&nbsp;G-NAF dataset&nbsp;in the upcoming August release.</p>
<p>The change&nbsp;focuses&nbsp;on a process that some users have found challenging when tracking addresses.</p>
<p>For example, when a property changes from a lot number to a rural address with street numbers, the tracking may be lost.&nbsp;The new Address Feature table will contain both principal and alias addresses, with the added ability to retain retired addresses.</p>
