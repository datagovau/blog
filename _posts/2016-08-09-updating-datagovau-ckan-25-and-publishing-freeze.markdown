title: Updating data.gov.au to CKAN 2.5 and Publishing Freeze
author: Allan Barger
---

<p>As part of our regular maintenance schedule we are updating the underlying software for data.gov.au to the <a href="http://ckan.org/">latest version of CKAN</a>.</p>
<p>This new version brings functional improvements to the site, increasing overall stability and adding more dependable functionality to core services <a href="http://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/maintaining/datastore.html">like the DataStore</a>.&nbsp;At this stage we are not making any aesthetic changes to the site, or underlying APIS and it will continue to have the same look and feel.</p>
<p>To help ensure the update is carried out with the least possible disruption we are <strong>closing the site for publishers from 5PM Thursday, 11 August to Monday, 15 August</strong>. This means no new datasets or resources can be uploaded to the site. All other user functions will continue to be accessible over the update period.</p>
<p>Full patch notes <a href="http://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/changelog.html">can be found on the CKAN website</a>.&nbsp;</p>
