title: DataStart – Data and Themes
author: Naomi Perdomo
---

<p>The DataStart information nights kicked off on Tuesday 17 November at the Pollenizer Headquarters in Sydney.</p>
<p>We’ll be talking about how you can apply for the program, the types of ideas we’re looking for and sharing some of the resources available to applicants.</p>
<p>There is lots of government data currently available for use, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Over 7,100 discoverable datasets on <a href="http://www.data.gov.au/">data.gov.au</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Over 2,900 datasets are viewable on the <a href="http://www.nationalmap.gov.au/">NationalMap</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <a href="http://nationalmap.gov.au/renewables/">AREMI map</a> – which provides access to renewable energy information, including electricity infrastructure, renewable energy, boundaries, topography and population.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All data from these sources is free and open – some available for download and some available as an API.</p>
<p>DataStart looks to test how these valuable data resources can be leveraged by the private sector to create commercial opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>Datasets by Theme</strong></p>

<p><strong>Example Problems</strong></p>
<p>We’ve come up with some potential challenges for DataStart applicants, have you got any to add?</p>
<p><strong>Power</strong>: Using government supplied power generation, transition capability, logistics information and environmental conditions to provide data-driven investment opportunities for the renewable and traditional power generation companies.</p>
<p><strong>Agriculture</strong>: Fusing Government environmental, water and land use data with farming industry price and stock data to provide data-driven decision support around stock management and horticultural investment to the agricultural industry.</p>
<p><strong>Insurance</strong>: Using open water observation from space datasets, surface water information and then fusing that with high quality built environment data and geocoded address data to provide more detailed flood risk information to the insurance industry.</p>
<p><strong>Communications</strong>: Fusing Broadband Quality and Mobile Black Spots data with terrain and population information to deliver services to business and the public on the quality and availability of communications when planning new business or moving house.</p>
