<p>Hi Folks,</p>
<p>In November 2015 the Australian Government committed to finalising membership of the Open Government Partnership (OGP). This is pretty exciting news and I know a lot of our open data and open government friends out there will want to contribute to the consultation.</p>
<p>The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, through the Public Data Branch, is the lead Commonwealth agency for developing the Australian Government’s National Action Plan. Our team will coordinate the consultation and resulting program of work and we’re keen to have representation and ideas from all parts of society, including civil society, industry, academia, cultural sectors, and from different areas of government across Australia. Our Branch are running this consultation as we have OGP expertise and we will make sure the agenda is not limited to open data, but rather covers far broader open government initiatives and considerations.</p>
<p>You can find more information, and all future updates, about consultation process by visiting <a href="https://ogpau.govspace.gov.au/">https://ogpau.govspace.gov.au/</a> with details about the consultation process available at <a href="https://ogpau.govspace.gov.au/national-action-plan/">https://ogpau.govspace.gov.au/national-action-plan/</a></p>

<p>Thanks and we look forward to working with you on developing an amazing Australian Government National Action Plan for open government.</p>
