<p>The May 2017&nbsp;release of the Geocoded National Address File (G-NAF) and Administrative Boundaries datasets are now available for download.</p>
<ul>
<li>PSMA Geocoded National Address File (G-NAF)&nbsp;<br><a href="https://data.gov.au/dataset/geocoded-national-address-file-g-naf%20">https://data.gov.au/dataset/geocoded-national-address-file-g-naf </a></li>
<li>PSMA Administrative Boundaries<br><a href="https://data.gov.au/dataset/psma-administrative-boundaries">https://data.gov.au/dataset/psma-administrative-boundaries</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We encourage users of the data to update to the latest versions.</p>
<p>We also invite users to provide feedback on the openly available G-NAF and Administrative Boundaries and ask that you please complete a short survey at: <a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/r/G-NAF-End-User-Survey"><strong>www.surveymonkey.com/r/G-NAF-End-User-Survey</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Your feedback is important for informing the future directions of the open G-NAF initiative by enabling us to build a more in-depth understanding of the innovation, efficiencies and productivity achieved through access to the open G-NAF.</p>
<p>This survey is published and managed by the Public Data Branch of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. All information provided will be treated as confidential and will only be used as aggregated data to inform policy decisions unless you specifically agree for your organisation’s use of open G-NAF to be used as a case study.</p>
<p>Responses to this survey are <strong>due by 9 June&nbsp;2017</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Background on the openly available G-NAF</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>On 26 February 2016, the Australian Government made PSMA’s <a href="http://www.data.gov.au/dataset/geocoded-national-address-file-g-naf">Geocoded National Address File (G-NAF)</a> openly available via <a href="http://www.data.gov.au/">data.gov.au</a> with updates published quarterly.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The G-NAF is one of Australia’s most ubiquitous and powerful spatial data sets and is now available free of charge. The G-NAF contains more than 13 million records for each physical address in Australia. Making the G-NAF openly available has removed licence barriers and enabled greater use of the data and opportunities for innovation.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The G-NAF can be used for a wide range of business or operational purposes, such as infrastructure planning, business planning and analysis, logistics and service planning, emergency and disaster response, personal navigation and mapping, fraud prevention, address validation at the point of entry for business and government, and effective government service delivery and policy development.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In its first year of open release, the G-NAF was downloaded more than 2,700 times. By comparison it was only downloaded around 120 times a year when it was available under restricted licence as a proprietary PSMA product.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you in advance for your participation in the survey, your feedback is valuable and appreciated.</p>
