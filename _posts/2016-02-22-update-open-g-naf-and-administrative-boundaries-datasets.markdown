<p>Thank you for your ongoing interest in the <a href="http://www.pm.gov.au/media/2015-12-07/driving-innovation-through-procurement-cyber-security-and-open-data">Australian Governmentâ€™s announcement of 7 December 2015</a> about <a href="/news-media/blog/geocoded-national-address-data-be-made-openly-available">making the Geocoded National Address File (G-NAF) and Administrative Boundaries datasets openly available in February 2016</a>.<br>&nbsp;<br>We have been working hard to finalise the data supply arrangements and internal processes so that we can make these datasets available through <a href="http://data.gov.au">data.gov.au </a>this month. We are working through the remaining details to publish the data.<br>&nbsp;<br>Making the G-NAF and Administrative Boundaries datasets openly available will remove barriers to greater use of the data and unlock and create opportunities for efficiencies and digital innovation. We look forward to innovative and entrepreneurial approaches to the use of these datasets now that they are to be made openly available.<br>&nbsp;<br>For additional information please refer to the FAQs which are available at: <a href="https://www.dpmc.gov.au/pmc/about-pmc/core-priorities/public-data-branch-within-dpmc/geocoded-national-address-data-be-made-openly-available">https://www.dpmc.gov.au/pmc/about-pmc/core-priorities/public-data-branch-within-dpmc/geocoded-national-address-data-be-made-openly-available</a>&#8203;</p>
