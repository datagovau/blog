<p>The August 2017&nbsp;release of the Geocoded National Address File (G-NAF) and Administrative Boundaries datasets are now available for download.</p>
<ul>
<li>PSMA Geocoded National Address File (G-NAF)&nbsp;<br><a href="https://data.gov.au/dataset/geocoded-national-address-file-g-naf">https://data.gov.au/dataset/geocoded-national-address-file-g-naf - external site</a></li>
<li>PSMA Administrative Boundaries<br><a href="https://data.gov.au/dataset/psma-administrative-boundaries">https://data.gov.au/dataset/psma-administrative-boundaries - external site</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We encourage users of the data to update to the latest versions.</p>
<p>We also thank users for providing feedback via a recent survey on the openly available G-NAF and Administrative Boundaries. Of the responses received:</p>
<ul>
<li>41% started using the G-NAF after it became openly available;</li>
<li>73% have achieved efficiencies and/or productivity growth as a result of open access to G-NAF;</li>
<li>83% use the open G-NAF for address verification, 44% integrate it into products, 43%&nbsp;use it for reporting and analytics and 29% use it for application development;</li>
<li>47% have introduced new operational processes and 41% have developed new goods or services;</li>
<li>50% have further developed existing operational processes and 45% have further developed existing goods or services;</li>
<li>97% rated G-NAF data as ‘good’ to ‘very high’ quality; and</li>
<li>63% use the openly available Administrative Boundaries dataset.</li>
</ul>
<p>Respondents indicated they are using the G-NAF data for a wide range of purposes including, planning transport services; developing new mapping applications; developing new insurance products and services for specific coverage areas; better utilisation of geocoding for property based services; integrating the data into existing business operations; and providing third party geocoded services.</p>
<p>This feedback provides a more in-depth understanding of the innovation, efficiencies and productivity achieved through access to the high-value spatial data.</p>
<p>Thank you also to those that have provided case studies of your organisations’ use of the open G-NAF and/or Administrative Boundaries datasets. Additional case studies can be forwarded to <a><a href="mailto:spatial@pmc.gov.au" class="spamspan">spatial@pmc.gov.au</a></a></p>
