title: Linked Employee-Employer Data
author: Naomi Perdomo
---

<p>The Australia Bureau of Statistics (ABS) is undergoing a major organisational transformation to capitalise on the opportunities of a dynamic information environment. One of its strategic priorities is to maximise the value of administrative data through integration and improved access.</p>
<p>This work includes the exploration of the creation of a Linked Employer-Employee Database (LEED).</p>
<p>A future LEED would:</p>
<ul>
<li>Integrate person and business administrative data sourced from the ATO.</li>
<li>Be linked longitudinally, as well as provide point in time data.</li>
<li>Build on the Expanded Analytical Business Longitudinal Database, which integrates business tax and survey data.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first step is a series of Foundation Projects being undertaken to demonstrate the value of LEED and assess the feasibility of integrating personal and business tax data.</p>
<p>On 11 December 2015, the ABS released an <a href="http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/6311.0main+features12011-12">Information Paper: Construction of Experimental Statistics on Employee Earnings and Jobs from Administrative Data, Australia 2011-12</a>.</p>
<p>The paper provides the background to the LEED Foundation Projects and outlines the approach taken to construct linked employer-employee data and experimental statistics on employee earnings and jobs.</p>
<p>The paper contains information on the data sources and integration methodology, a summary of results, and future directions for the LEED in the ABS.</p>
<p>The public is invited to provide feedback on the LEED Foundation Projects by contacting the ABS Labour and Income Branch on (02) 6252 7206 or via <a href="mailto:labour.statistics@abs.gov.au" class="spamspan">labour.statistics@abs.gov.au</a>.
