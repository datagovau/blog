<p>We are very pleased to <a href="https://index.okfn.org/place/">see that Australia has placed equal first</a> (<em>with Taiwan</em>) in the latest edition of the Open Knowledge Institute’s Global Open Data Index. The result is a recognition of the work being done across government to make more open data available in Australia.</p>
<p>The Global Open Data Index is an annual global benchmark that ranks how well nations publish open government data against 14 categories. Australia performed extremely well against all but two of the benchmarks set by the survey.</p>
<p>In his <a href="http://ministers.dpmc.gov.au/taylor/2017/australia-leading-world-open-government-data">media release</a>, the Assistant Minister for Cities and Digital Transformation Angus Taylor said that:</p>
<blockquote><p>“I'm delighted to see that our steadfast commitment to open data has been recognised globally by a renowned independent assessor. We must now ensure that we keep this momentum going in order to fill the gaps highlighted by the global index and build on our initial successes.”</p></blockquote>
<p>We recognise that this would not have been possible without the efforts of many government agencies making data available in line with the <a href="https://www.dpmc.gov.au/sites/default/files/publications/aust_govt_public_data_policy_statement_1.pdf">Government’s Public Data Policy Statement</a>.</p>
