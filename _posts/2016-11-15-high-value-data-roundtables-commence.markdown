author: Nick Newhouse

<p>In June 2016, the Australian Government released the <a href="https://www.liberal.org.au/coalitions-policy-better-and-more-accessible-digital-services"><em>Better and More Accessible Digital Services </em></a>policy and committed to working with the research, not-for-profit and private sectors to identify high-value public datasets for release. This will be supported by a public registry of significant non-sensitive datasets, another election commitment from the same Government policy.</p>
<p>On 25 October, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet held the first High-Value Data Roundtable at the <a href="http://thesource.dss.gov.au/2016-longitudinal-data-conference">Longitudinal Data Conference 2016</a>. The ongoing data roundtables with members of the community who use data will help identify high-value data characteristics, high-value datasets and include a frank discussion on issues and barriers to data access.</p>
<p>During the first roundtable, over 30 members of the research sector attended including representatives from the Australian Research Council, Research Australia, University of Tasmania, Monash University, University of Queensland, Roy Morgan Research and SA-NT Datalink.</p>

<p>Professor Fiona Stanley AC, School of Paediatrics and Child Health at the University of Western Australia presented on the value of public data. Professor Stanley, an epidemiologist, uses population data to provide health, social and economic benefits to the community. She established the Telethon Institute for Child Health Research, a unique multidisciplinary independent research institute focusing on the causes and prevention of major problems affecting children and youth.</p>

<p>Following consultations with the research, not-for-profit and private sectors, the Department will develop a High-Value Dataset Framework which will help Government to identify and prioritise the release of high-value datasets.</p>
