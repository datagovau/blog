title: Release of process for publishing sensitive unit record level public data as open data
author: Simon Quarrell
---

<p>As set out in the <a href="https://www.dpmc.gov.au/sites/default/files/publications/aust_govt_public_data_policy_statement_1.pdf" target="_blank">Australian Government Public Data Policy Statement</a>, data held by the Australian Government is an important strategic national resource that holds considerable value for growing the economy, improving service delivery and transforming public policy outcomes. The Australian Government also recognises that the privacy of individuals is of paramount importance.</p>
<p>The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet&nbsp;has developed a&nbsp;process&nbsp;setting out a method that Australian Government Agencies need to follow to release sensitive unit record datasets as open data. &nbsp;This will ensure that these datasets have been protected to the highest standard. &nbsp;The process is intended to apply to datasets released on data.gov.au, as well as data made available openly through agency websites.</p>
<p>The process only applies to the release of sensitive unit record datasets as open data. The process is not intended to cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>unit record datasets that are not sensitive;</li>
<li>datasets that are too sensitive to be made openly available, and cannot be adequately de-identified; or</li>
<li>datasets that are only released by the data custodian to a limited number of researchers under contract.</li>
</ul>
<p>The process is available from these links:</p>
