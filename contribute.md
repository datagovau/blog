## Write a blog post

### Think about the outcome
You should have a clear outcome in mind before starting to design your blog post.

The outcome could be to share a key piece of learning, to demonstrate an interesting open source project, or to request community participation in an event or activity relating to open data.

### Keep it simple, clear and fast
Content that is easier to read is more effective.

We recommend that you follow the [Content Guide](https://guides.service.gov.au/content-guide/how-to-use-guide/) to help you design simple, clear and fast content.

### Format
[Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) is our preferred content format. 

## Submit the blog post
Please submit a pull request containing your draft blog post via GitHub.

- demonstrates the value of open data

- simple, clear and fast content - please ensure you follow the [Content Guide](https://guides.service.gov.au/content-guide/)
